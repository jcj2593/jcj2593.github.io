      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

      <description>Throughout this SDS 348 class, the majority of coding that I have learned has been through using R. I really enjoyed R because it was not difficult to learn, the software for calculating and presenting statistical data was very clear/straightforward, and it gave me an appreciation for how coding works and why it is so valuable in the world we live in today. Unfortunately, like everything in life all good things must come to an end… or do they?</description>
