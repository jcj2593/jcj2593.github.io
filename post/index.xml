      <description>Throughout this SDS 348 class, the majority of coding that I have learned has been through using R. I really enjoyed R because it was not difficult to learn, the software for calculating and presenting statistical data was very clear/straightforward, and it gave me an appreciation for how coding works and why it is so valuable in the world we live in today. Unfortunately, like everything in life all good things must come to an endâ€¦ or do they?</description>
